# HomeHero🦸🏻‍♂️
👨🏻‍🎓 This is a project created by students from the *University of Cundinamarca🏫, Facatativá campus*. The focus of this project is to provide a tool that allows potential users to offer or request voluntary help, specifying details such as payments, number of required people, and ratings⭐️⭐️⭐️.

At the time of development, Visual Studio was used, and thanks to the recommendations given by the professor🧑🏻‍🏫, we were able to effectively link our repository on GitHub, helping us to make a more organized distribution of work and allowing clear records of the changes made by each team member 👨🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻.
